                        Netiquette a colloquial portmanteau of network etiquette or Internet etiquette, is a set of social conventions that facilitate
                        interaction over networks, ranging from Usenet and mailing lists to blogs and forums.

                        Like the network itself, these developing norms remain in a state of flux and vary from community to community. The points
                        most strongly emphasized about Usenet netiquette often include using simple electronic signatures,
                        and avoiding multiposting, cross-posting, off-topic posting, hijacking a discussion thread, and other
                        techniques used to minimize the effort required to read a post or a thread. Similarly, some Usenet
                        guidelines call for use of unabbreviated English while users of instant messaging protocols like
                        SMS occasionally encourage just the opposite, bolstering use of SMS language. However, many online
                        communities frown upon this practice. Common rules for e-mail and Usenet such as avoiding flamewars
                        and spam are constant across most mediums and communities. Another rule is to avoid typing in all
                        caps or grossly enlarging script for emphasis, which is considered to be the equivalent of shouting
                        or yelling. Other commonly shared points, such as remembering that one's posts are (or can easily
                        be made) public, are generally intuitively understood by publishers of Web pages and posters to Usenet,
                        although this rule is somewhat flexible depending on the environment. On more private protocols,
                        however, such as e-mail and SMS, some users take the privacy of their posts for granted. One-on-one
                        communications, such as private messages on chat forums and direct SMSs, may be considered more private
                        than other such protocols, but infamous breaches surround even these relatively private media. For
                        example, Paris Hilton's Sidekick PDA was cracked in 2005, resulting in the publication of her private
                        photos, SMS history, address book, etc.

                        been defined as "the ability to participate in society online". The term is often mentioned in relation

                        has also become an issue of academic interest. The rapid adoption of the device has resulted in the
                        intrusion of telephony into situations where it was previously not used. This has exposed the implicit
                        rules of courtesy and opened them to reevaluation.
